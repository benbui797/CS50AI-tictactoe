# CS50AI-tictactoe
Week 1 project for CS50AI: tictactoe AI utilising minimax function

pygame code was provided by CS50, implementation of the AI was the assignment.

If both players play perfectly, the game should always end in a tie. 
The AI checks all moves recursively using minimax function and should be unbeatable :)
